# code-quiz
Overview: 

- made a timed code quiz on coding facts to make my user more aware and knowledgable regarding different web development processes and languages 

How it works: 

- the user will go through a series of questions and choose their best answer once they start the "start" button and will finish either when they finish the quiz or the clock runs out 

Needed:

- series of questions to ask the user
- added a timer once presented with a questions counting down from 60 seconds 
- results of score on the all done container 
- highscores page 
- saved results on scores page (highscore) with initials 
- add addEventListeners for buttons 
- if/else statements for right and wrongs quesitons 
- for loop for my array of questions 


What I was able to actually add:

- highscores page 
- countdown timer going down from 60 seconds
- subtracts 5 seconds every time user clicks on wrong question
- coding quiz start page with start button 
- start button starting timer and questions 
- addEventListeners for buttons 
- for loop going through my questions whether user clicks on right or wrong answer 
- timer stops when hits zero and stops user from answering anymore questions - heads to all done page
- timer stops when user is done with last question- heads to the all done page 
- used a navigation bar from bootsrap and changed it up so where my background could be different but not hide the timer and highscores page link
- added favicon 

What else i needed:

- final score on my all done page
    ~ had some trouble figuring out the functionality for keeping track of score. i had it on the js page but it was causing an error/ or not working at all
-  beacuse i was trying to figure out for the longest how to keep track of the user score, i didnt get to the form where user submits intitials and page stores score onto my index2.html page
- know that i had to use setitem and getitem along the way 
- needed some css styling for buttons 
- fix a property error 

Overall: 

- fun coding and i definetely enjoy styling things as needed
- VERY hard
